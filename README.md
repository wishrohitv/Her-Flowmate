## 🏗️ Technical & Clinical Core

### 📅 Clinical Accuracy (LMP)
HerFlowmate follows strict medical standards for pregnancy tracking:
- **LMP-Based Logic**: All calculations represent the **Last Menstrual Period (LMP)**.
- **280-Day Rule**: Due dates are calculated as `LMP + 280 days`.
- **Accurate Weeks**: Progress is computed as `(Today - LMP) / 7 + 1`.

### 🛡️ Web Stability (Fragment-First)
To ensure a crash-free experience on Flutter Web/Chrome, the app uses a proprietary **Fragment-First Architecture**:
- **Atomic Components**: High-density UI elements are built as standalone, stateless fragments to avoid nested scrollable deadlocks.
- **Nuclear Stability**: Optimized for performance by replacing complex blurs (BackdropFilters) with high-speed linear gradients.
